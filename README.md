# MLShopHelper

![MLShopHelper Header](public/MLSHHeader.png)

MLShopHelper is a collaborative, crowdsourced price tracker and inventory datasheet for MapleLegends items. It empowers the community to track, analyze, and share item prices and shop inventories in real time. All you have to do is log the items you sell and the price you sell them for. The app will handle the rest.

## What Makes It Unique?
- **Crowdsourced Data:** Anyone can submit prices and sales for items. The app aggregates data from all users, making it a living, up-to-date price reference for the ML community.
- **No Personal Info Required:** Logins are managed by a secret key. You never need to provide email, Discord, or any personal details.
- **Modern, Fast UI:** Built with Tauri 2.x, React, and TypeScript for a smooth, desktop-native experience.
- **Filtering by Friends:** Filter items by friends who sell them if you only want to see prices from trusted contributors. (coming soon)
- **Admin-Only Item Management:** Only users with the `admin` label can add new items to the global item list.

## Key Features
- **Inventory Management:** Add, edit, and organize shop items. Track stock counts and potential store sale value.
- **Price History Tracking:** View detailed box-plot 30d price history for each item.
- **Price Analytics:** See boxplot charts and statistics for item prices, including outlier filtering.
- **Hotkeys:** Searching, Adding Items to Store and Selling Items without touching the mouse.
- **Shop Uptime Tracking:** Set timers for monitoring shop uptime, with automatic closure after 24 hours. Supports tracking multiple shops concurrently, with data displayed in the dashboard.

## Known Limitations & Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Code Signing:** Deferred as the project is in the validation phase. Transparency is ensured via provenance and open-source code. (Code signing costs are currently exorbitant & prohibitive.)
- [ ] **Downvoting Feature:** The downvoting mechanism for flagging inaccurate sales data is incomplete and may not function reliably.
- [ ] **Adding/Filtering/Managing Friends:** Adding and filtering by friends is incomplete and may have usability pitfalls.
- [ ] **Fuzzy Search Limitations:** Items with unconventional names may yield suboptimal matches. Please report issues via GitHub Issues.
- [ ] **Boxplot and Price History Display:** Tested only on 2â€“3 days of data. 30d history and data management need more practical testing.
- [ ] **Other Usability Pitfalls:** Various other usability issues may exist as the app is still being validated.

## Trust and Security

As an indie dev, I know running a third-party .exe can raise questions. Hereâ€™s why MLShopHelper is safe:

- **Open-Source**: The code is public. Check it out or build it yourself!
- **SLSA Provenance**: GitHub Actions verifies the .exe matches and is built directly from the source code. Verify with GitHub CLI. (see releases for instructions)
- **VirusTotal Scan**: Releases are scanned clean by major antivirus engines: report. **I encourage you to rescan it yourself** for peace of mind.
- **SHA-256 Checksum**: Confirm integrity with:

    ```
    SHA-256: 34f982a5688bd4bc5d487b715ab101063edeaeb70dfb7d5b7194a11def99830a
    ```
- **Unsigned .exe**: As a solo dev in beta, Iâ€™m skipping code signing to save costs. Provenance and scans ensure transparency.

For full details, see the notes attached to each release.

## ðŸ“¦ Appwrite Collections & Schema

Below are the required Appwrite collections and their expected attribute schemas. Expand each section for details:

<details>
<summary><strong>Items Collection</strong></summary>

<p><em>Purpose:</em> Stores all items that users can add to their shop inventory, including item name, price, notes, and ownership status.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> The <strong>Add Item</strong> feature is restricted to users with the <code>admin</code> label on the built-in Appwrite users collection. Only admins can add new items to the global item list.</p>

### How to Use

- When setting up your Appwrite backend, create collections with the above attribute schemas and purposes in mind.
- <strong>Permissions are critical:</strong> For each collection, configure read/write/update/delete permissions according to the recommendations above. This usually means allowing users to access their own data, and only admins or the backend to update global or sensitive data.
- Attribute types and requirements must match for the app to work correctly.
- Adjust collection names/IDs as needed, but update your `.env` accordingly.
